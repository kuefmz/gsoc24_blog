This week we had a meeting at the beginning of the week and some async discussions about the project.

The progress of the week:
- The proxy is corrected using the proxy.py library.
- The basic functionality is implemented for the failover mode.
- Dockerfile is created.
- Deployed to the the DBpedia server, so it can be tested here: 95.217.207.179:8182

Next steps:
- The proxy is not working for https, as so that has to be fixed.
- Extend the functionality.
- Change the logging from prints to logger.
