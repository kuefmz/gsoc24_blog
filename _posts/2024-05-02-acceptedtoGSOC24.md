I'm thrilled to shared that Iâ€™ve been accepted into Google Summer of Code 2024 to work on a project with DBpedia.

#### The Project: Ontology Time Machine / Package Manager using DBpedia Archivo for DBpedia

The project focuses on improving DBpedia Archivo, an ontology archive containing over 1800 versioned snapshots of ontologies. It addresses the challenges of ontology evolution and unavailability, which can impact the development of data-driven applications that rely on interconnected web ontologies. The project's primary goal is to improve the FAIRness (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability) of ontologies for linked data and RDF knowledge graphs through DBpedia Archivo.
