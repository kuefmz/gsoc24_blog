## Progress
- Continue the work on implementing the parameters. 

## Discussion
- We realized that the implementation of all the parameters and the different functionalities will not fit into this project.
- The dependency mode out not in the scope of the project
- Some of the subparameters are also outside of the scope of the project

## Next steps
- Continues the implementation of the parameters
