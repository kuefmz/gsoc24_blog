The progress of the week:
- The issue with the deployed docker is found, the CMD command was missing some parameters.
- Some testcases were broken with the previous PR, I fixed them.
- Refactor the code and make sure that the GET requests are only called once in case of any scenario.
- Work on handling the Accept headers and return the requested versions accordingly.


Next steps:
- Add the parameter using the argparse library that were defined by Johannes
- Implement the functionalities that are expected in case of the different parameter values.
