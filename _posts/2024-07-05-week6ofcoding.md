The progress of the week:
- Extending the functionality of the proxy
- Adding the parameters that were defined by Johannes to fine-tune the functionality and make sure that is can be deployed with parameters tuned to the user's needs.
- Implement the placeholders for all the possible modes.
- Implement most of the functionalities accordingly to the parameters.

Discussion:
- What is the importance of the parameters, and what are the priorities.
- Discuss what do Johannes means by intercepting only the ontology related HTTPS request.

Next steps:
- Implement test cases to make sure that the parameters work as expected
- Make sure that the proxy only intercepts HTTPS request in case the request can be found in DBpedia Archivo
- Change some of the libraries based on feedback from Natanael.
