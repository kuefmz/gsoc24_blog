## Progress
- Ontology and logic implementation updates

## Dicsussion
- Move all the logic of the proxy into the a separate file for the logic
    - This will help changing to other proxy libraries later if we decide to do so
- Logic refactoring: Moved all relevant logic into separate utilities for better organization and reusability.
- Parameter Fixes: Adjusted parameters to ensure correct functionality and handling.


## Next steps
- Deploy the default setup of the ontology to dbpedia
