Discussion:
- Proxy: time based mode
	- gives all the 


my ontology is subclass of person
if a term is dependent on another term then I have to look that other term up and check the requirements
it the other ontology has changed then I have to adjust accodingly
if the ontology is not available anymore then we point it to the ontology snapshot
and for that we need to identfy the ontology file for the specific concepts

#IRI: we don't know exactly where it is located
/IRIs: we just take the part 

the proxy will never see the info aftet the #

STart with the simple case, with tha # case



Dependency

Assume you have some ontology:

@prefix myont: <http://example.org/myontology/> .
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

myont:Cook rdfs:subClassOf foaf:Person.


This Ontology would depend on the foaf-Ontology.

Dependency can be a general dependency, but could also be a dependency on a specific version of an Ontology.


Transparent Proxy

Caveat: Hash-IRIs vs. Slash-IRIs.


Infer the Ontology IRI from on a Term (Class, Property)

Explicit Semantics

Based on rdfs:isDefinedBy unfortunately is not available, if the ontology is not available.

Additionally: Distinguish between multiple statements

We have to identify the authoritative source. E.g. based on the IRI substring.

Using the SOLR Index

Based on the IRI

Remove the ""last part" (what ever is the "last part") from the IRI.

Failover mode: the proxy want to get an IRI first, but the Person are not available
Timebased mode: 

Ticket: get a test case for the proxy an implement accordingly

Query for every class that is a cubclass of everything else


Problem: I want to make a consitenty test of an ontology, but in order to do that everythin has to be available
But with the proxy everyhting would be there

TODO: lookup a python lybrary that does consistency test on ontology

Babelnet ontology

pick an ontology that is not available at the moment 

1st step: fetch the URI that is not available at the moment but we get it from the Archivo snapshot


Start first the failover-mode: if it's not available we give the latest available 
Time travel model is easier then the dependency mode but they are very related but we will have dependencies 
It could be that the dependency is not available in a certain time but we need some logic here


Dependency issues are out of scope

There are some flask middleware thing

but we need a proxy

It should be an http procxy that I can configure in my browser


Check what python lybrary should be used for the proxy

Let through most of the requests and some specific URL say a random stuff like Hello
Nothing archivo specific but just checking if the 

For the dependency stuff would work just like poetry, 

Transparent Proxy


The Proxy has two modes:

* fail over (in the case a term or ontology is requested, but is not available online/at its IRI, so it takes the most recent version from archivo)
* time travel (the proxy is configured to always answer from archivo by taking the version according to one of the following strategies)
    * time travel (Based on a time stamp the ontology version is selected, closest or last; time > snapshot)
    * dependency-lock (based on a dependency description, see below, that is specified in the dependency description)

general dependency

myont: - depends on → foaf:


specific version

myont: - depends on → foaf from 2014-01-14 13.37
