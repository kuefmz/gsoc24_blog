I had the first meeting with my mentors: [Johannes Frey](https://aksw.org/JohannesFrey) and [Natanael Arndt](https://aksw.org/NatanaelArndt).

We introduced ourselves and discussed the basic setup.

This two GitHub repositories will be used for the project:
- [Ontology Time Machine](https://github.com/dbpedia/ontology-time-machine)
- [Ontology Package Manager](https://github.com/dbpedia/ontology-package-manager)

We will follow agile framework. For managing the tasks we will use GitHub issue tracker. I will use Python for coding. The documentation will be done in the README.md file of the repositories. Each function will have a detailed description in the code as comments and a documentation will also be generated from the code. For testing I will create Pytests and setup a CI in GitHub. The project will be deployed, the server need to be set up by Johannes.

I was provided with some articles and publications related to DBpedia and the project to get familiar with it:
